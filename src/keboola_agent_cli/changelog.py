CHANGELOG: dict[str, list[str]] = {
    "0.22.0": [
        "New: `kbagent config set-default-bucket` -- set or clear `configuration.storage.output.default_bucket` on a configuration without raw-mode JSON edits. Discoverable wrapper around the workaround documented at https://keboola.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SUP/pages/3770155030/ (epic KBCP-108). Read-modify-write preserves sibling keys; `--dry-run` previews; same-value writes short-circuit with `{'changed': false}`.",
    ],
    "0.21.1": [
        "Fix: sync pull on a newly created dev branch now writes config rows (#193) -- idempotent skip guard for rows was missing a file-existence check, causing rows to be silently skipped when the branch directory was new (hash matched main because the branch is a clone)",
    ],
    "0.21.0": [
        "New: config variables-set / variables-get / variables-clear -- variables as a first-class attachment, not a resource to manage. Auto-creates the backing keboola.variables config + default row on first set, merges or replaces on update, encrypts #-prefixed values fail-closed, unlinks without deleting the backing config.",
        "New: sync push now deploys config rows (create/update/delete via /rows endpoints) -- previously rows edited locally were silently skipped (FIIA P0-1)",
        "New: #-prefixed secret values in row YAMLs are encrypted via the Encryption API before push, same fail-closed semantics as parent configs (FIIA P1-5)",
        "New: keboola.variables / keboola.shared-code row YAMLs hoist 'values' / 'code_content' to top level (matches kbc push convention) instead of hiding under _configuration_extra",
        "New: per-row 3-way diff -- sync status/diff now reports added/modified/deleted rows alongside parent configs; local row edits are preserved across pull",
        "New: ManifestConfigRow.metadata with pull_hash + pull_config_hash -- manifest schema bumped to v3 (v2 manifests load cleanly and upgrade in-place on next pull)",
        "Fix: _write_config_file now uses newline='' so Windows doesn't translate LF->CRLF on write, which previously caused every post-pull status to report every config as modified",
        "New: `kbagent job run` auto-resolves `variableValuesId` for configs with linked `keboola.variables` -- transformations now run against deployed values instead of empty `{{ placeholder }}` strings (FIIA runtime loop).",
        "New: `--variable-values-id ID` on `job run` to override the auto-resolved values row; `--no-variables` to skip resolution entirely (mutually exclusive).",
        "New: `NO_VARIABLE_ROWS` error code when a linked variables config has zero rows (fix via `kbagent config variables-set`); `MALFORMED_VARIABLES_ROW` when the Storage API returns a first row without a usable `id` -- fail loud instead of silently submitting with empty bindings.",
        'Reject: `--variable-values-id ""` (empty or whitespace) returns exit 2 / `INVALID_ARGUMENT` instead of silently dropping the Queue body field.',
        "Client: `create_job` gained `variable_values_id` parameter; omitted from body when unset so existing callers retain wire-level compatibility.",
        "Response: `kbagent --json job run` now carries `resolvedVariableValuesId` so callers can verify the binding without a second `job detail` round-trip.",
    ],
    "0.20.6": [
        "Fix: storage download-table / unload-table no longer OOM on multi-GB tables -- streamed downloads cap RAM at ~1 MiB regardless of table size (#187)",
        "Fix: _prepend_csv_header() no longer loads the full CSV into RAM (was the second OOM source after slice download)",
        "New: storage download-table --keep-slices -- save each slice as its own file under <output>/ (DuckDB/polars/Spark friendly), with a _columns.csv sidecar for the header",
        "New: storage unload-table --download --keep-slices -- same option for the file-export flow (CSV only; parquet has been sliced from day one)",
    ],
    "0.20.5": [
        "Docs: Parquet export covered in CLAUDE.md, skill commands-reference, storage-files-workflow, and gotchas (CONTRIBUTING.md compliance follow-up to 0.20.3)",
        "Test: new E2E case for 'unload-table --file-type parquet' (slice layout + _manifest.json + PAR1 magic bytes)",

        "New: default parquet output path ./{project}/{table_id}.parquet/ (Hive-style, pyarrow-ready)",
        "New: storage file-download auto-detects sliced .parquet files and writes them per-slice",
        "New: client.download_sliced_file_to_dir() -- preserves slices instead of binary-concatenating (unsafe for parquet)",
    ],
    "0.20.2": [
        "New: job terminate -- kill Queue API jobs with --job-id or bulk --status filter (#181)",
        "New: --status any filter for terminating all killable jobs (created+waiting+processing)",
        "New: client helper kill_job + service terminate_jobs with partition response (killed/already_finished/not_found/failed)",
        "New: job.terminate permission (destructive class) for policy-based gating",
    ],
    "0.20.1": [
        "New: project description-get / description-set -- read/write the Keboola dashboard project description (markdown)",
        "New: branch metadata-list / metadata-get / metadata-set / metadata-delete -- generic CRUD over branch metadata (KBC.* keys)",

        "New: lineage info -- inspect graph contents (projects, tables, top connections)",
